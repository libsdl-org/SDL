* Added EGL_KHR_create_context support to allow OpenGL ES version selection on some platforms
* Added NV12 and NV21 YUV texture support for OpenGL and OpenGL ES 2.0 renderers
* Added a Vivante video driver that is used on various SoC platforms
* Added an event SDL_RENDER_DEVICE_RESET that is sent from the D3D renderers when the D3D device is lost, and from Android's event loop when the GLES context had to be recreated
* Added a hint SDL_HINT_NO_SIGNAL_HANDLERS to disable SDL's built in signal handling
* Added a hint SDL_HINT_THREAD_STACK_SIZE to set the stack size of SDL's threads

* Added SDL_SetWindowsMessageHook() to set a function to be called for every windows message before TranslateMessage()
* Added a hint SDL_HINT_WINDOWS_ENABLE_MESSAGELOOP to control whether SDL_PumpEvents() processes the Windows message loop

* SDL_GetWindowSize() and display mode sizes are in the "DPI-independent points" coordinate space rather than pixels (matches OS X behavior)
* SDL_SysWMinfo now contains the OpenGL ES framebuffer and color renderbuffer objects used by the window's active GLES view
* Fixed various rotation and orientation issues
* Fixed memory leaks

Android:
* Added a hint SDL_HINT_ANDROID_SEPARATE_MOUSE_AND_TOUCH to prevent mouse events from being registered as touch events

* EGL can now create/manage OpenGL and OpenGL ES 1.x/2.x contexts, and share
  them using SDL_GL_SHARE_WITH_CURRENT_CONTEXT
* Added a field "clicks" to the mouse button event which records whether the event is a single click, double click, etc.
* The screensaver is now disabled by default, and there is a hint SDL_HINT_VIDEO_ALLOW_SCREENSAVER that can change that behavior.
* Added a hint SDL_HINT_MOUSE_RELATIVE_MODE_WARP to specify whether mouse relative mode should be emulated using mouse warping.
* testgl2 does not need to link with libGL anymore
* Added testgles2 test program to demonstrate working with OpenGL ES 2.0

  support won't be available).

    SDL_UpdateYUVTexture()

* Fixed detecting a mixture of XInput and DirectInput controllers
* Fixed clearing a D3D render target larger than the window
* Improved support for format specifiers in SDL_snprintf()

Mac OS X:
* Added support for retina displays:
  Create your window with the SDL_WINDOW_ALLOW_HIGHDPI flag, and then use SDL_GL_GetDrawableSize() to find the actual drawable size. You are responsible for scaling mouse and drawing coordinates appropriately.
* Fixed mouse warping in fullscreen mode
* Right mouse click is emulated by holding the Ctrl key while left clicking

Linux:
* Fixed float audio support with the PulseAudio driver
* Fixed missing line endpoints in the OpenGL renderer on some drivers
