# Using this package

This package contains SDL built for the Android platform.

## Gradle integration

For integration with CMake/ndk-build, it uses [prefab](https://google.github.io/prefab/).

Copy the aar archive (@<@PROJECT_NAME@>@-@<@PROJECT_VERSION@>@.aar) to a `app/libs` directory of your project.

In `app/build.gradle` of your Android project, add:
```
android {
    /* ... */
    buildFeatures {
        prefab true
    }
}
dependencies {
    implementation files('libs/@<@PROJECT_NAME@>@-@<@PROJECT_VERSION@>@.aar')
    /* ... */
}
```

If you're using CMake, add the following to your CMakeLists.txt:
```
find_package(@<@PROJECT_NAME@>@ REQUIRED CONFIG)
target_link_libraries(yourgame PRIVATE @<@PROJECT_NAME@>@::@<@PROJECT_NAME@>@)
```

If you use ndk-build, add the following before `include $(BUILD_SHARED_LIBRARY)` to your `Android.mk`:
```
LOCAL_SHARED_LIBARARIES := SDL3 SDL3-Headers
```
And add the following at the bottom:
```
# https://google.github.io/prefab/build-systems.html

# Add the prefab modules to the import path.
$(call import-add-path,/out)

# Import @<@PROJECT_NAME@>@ so we can depend on it.
$(call import-module,prefab/@<@PROJECT_NAME@>@)
```

---

## Other build systems (advanced)

If you want to build a project without Gradle,
running the following command will extract the Android archive into a more common directory structure.
```
python @<@PROJECT_NAME@>@-@<@PROJECT_VERSION@>@.aar -o android_prefix
```
Add `--help` for a list of all available options.
