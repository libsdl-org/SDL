  <interface name="xdg_wm_dialog_v1" version="1">
    <description summary="create dialogs related to other toplevels">
      The xdg_wm_dialog_v1 interface is exposed as a global object allowing
      to register surfaces with a xdg_toplevel role as "dialogs" relative to
      another toplevel.

      The compositor may let this relation influence how the surface is
      placed, displayed or interacted with.

      Warning! The protocol described in this file is currently in the testing
      phase. Backward compatible changes may be added together with the
      corresponding interface version bump. Backward incompatible changes can
      only be done by creating a new major version of the extension.

  <interface name="xdg_dialog_v1" version="1">
    <description summary="dialog object">
      A xdg_dialog_v1 object is an ancillary object tied to a xdg_toplevel. Its
      purpose is hinting the compositor that the toplevel is a "dialog" (e.g. a
      temporary window) relative to another toplevel (see
      xdg_toplevel.set_parent). If the xdg_toplevel is destroyed, the xdg_dialog_v1
      becomes inert.

      Through this object, the client may provide additional hints about
      the purpose of the secondary toplevel. This interface has no effect
      on toplevels that are not attached to a parent toplevel.

    <request name="destroy" type="destructor">
      <description summary="destroy the dialog object">
        Destroys the xdg_dialog_v1 object. If this object is destroyed
        before the related xdg_toplevel, the compositor should unapply its
        effects.

    </request>

    <request name="set_modal">
      <description summary="mark dialog as modal">
        Hints that the dialog has "modal" behavior. Modal dialogs typically
        require to be fully addressed by the user (i.e. closed) before resuming
        interaction with the parent toplevel, and may require a distinct
        presentation.

        Clients must implement the logic to filter events in the parent
        toplevel on their own.

        Compositors may choose any policy in event delivery to the parent
        toplevel, from delivering all events unfiltered to using them for
        internal consumption.
