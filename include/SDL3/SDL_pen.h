 *
 * SDL pen event handling.
 *
 * SDL provides an API for pressure-sensitive pen (stylus and/or eraser)
 * handling, e.g., for input and drawing tablets or suitably equipped mobile /
 * tablet devices.
 *
 * To get started with pens, simply handle pen events:
 *
 * - SDL_EVENT_PEN_PROXIMITY_IN, SDL_EVENT_PEN_PROXIMITY_OUT
 *   (SDL_PenProximityEvent)
 * - SDL_EVENT_PEN_DOWN, SDL_EVENT_PEN_UP (SDL_PenTouchEvent)
 * - SDL_EVENT_PEN_MOTION (SDL_PenMotionEvent)
 * - SDL_EVENT_PEN_BUTTON_DOWN, SDL_EVENT_PEN_BUTTON_UP (SDL_PenButtonEvent)
 * - SDL_EVENT_PEN_AXIS (SDL_PenAxisEvent)
 *
 * Pens may provide more than simple touch input; they might have other axes,
 * such as pressure, tilt, rotation, etc.
 *
 * When a pen starts providing input, SDL will assign it a unique SDL_PenID,
 * which will remain for the life of the process, as long as the pen stays
 * connected. A pen leaving proximity (being taken far enough away from the
 * digitizer tablet that it no longer reponds) and then coming back should
 * fire proximity events, but the SDL_PenID should remain consistent.
 * Unplugging the digitizer and reconnecting may cause future input to have a
 * new SDL_PenID, as SDL may not know that this is the same hardware.
 *
 * Please note that various platforms vary wildly in how (and how well) they
 * support pen input. If your pen supports some piece of functionality but SDL
 * doesn't seem to, it might actually be the operating system's fault. For
 * example, some platforms can manage multiple devices at the same time, but
 * others will make any connected pens look like a single logical device, much
 * how all USB mice connected to a computer will move the same system cursor.
 * cursor. Other platforms might not support pen buttons, or the distance
 * axis, etc. Very few platforms can even report _what_ functionality the pen
 * supports in the first place, so best practices is to either build UI to let
 * the user configure their pens, or be prepared to handle new functionality
 * for a pen the first time an event is reported.
