/**
 * Open a specific audio device.
 *
 * Passing in a `device` name of NULL requests the most reasonable default.
 * The `device` name is a UTF-8 string reported by SDL_GetAudioDeviceName(),
 * but some drivers allow arbitrary and driver-specific strings, such as a
 * hostname/IP address for a remote audio server, or a filename in the
 * diskaudio driver.
 *
 * An opened audio device starts out paused, and should be enabled for playing
 * by calling SDL_PlayAudioDevice(devid) when you are ready for your audio
 * callback function to be called. Since the audio driver may modify the
 * requested size of the audio buffer, you should allocate any local mixing
 * buffers after you open the audio device.
 *
 * The audio callback runs in a separate thread in most cases; you can prevent
 * race conditions between your callback and other threads without fully
 * pausing playback with SDL_LockAudioDevice(). For more information about the
 * callback, see SDL_AudioSpec.
 *
 * Managing the audio spec via 'desired' and 'obtained':
 *
 * When filling in the desired audio spec structure:
 *
 * - `desired->freq` should be the frequency in sample-frames-per-second (Hz).
 * - `desired->format` should be the audio format (`SDL_AUDIO_S16SYS`, etc).
 * - `desired->samples` is the desired size of the audio buffer, in _sample
 *   frames_ (with stereo output, two samples--left and right--would make a
 *   single sample frame). This number should be a power of two, and may be
 *   adjusted by the audio driver to a value more suitable for the hardware.
 *   Good values seem to range between 512 and 8096 inclusive, depending on
 *   the application and CPU speed. Smaller values reduce latency, but can
 *   lead to underflow if the application is doing heavy processing and cannot
 *   fill the audio buffer in time. Note that the number of sample frames is
 *   directly related to time by the following formula: `ms =
 *   (sampleframes*1000)/freq`
 * - `desired->size` is the size in _bytes_ of the audio buffer, and is
 *   calculated by SDL_OpenAudioDevice(). You don't initialize this.
 * - `desired->silence` is the value used to set the buffer to silence, and is
 *   calculated by SDL_OpenAudioDevice(). You don't initialize this.
 * - `desired->callback` should be set to a function that will be called when
 *   the audio device is ready for more data. It is passed a pointer to the
 *   audio buffer, and the length in bytes of the audio buffer. This function
 *   usually runs in a separate thread, and so you should protect data
 *   structures that it accesses by calling SDL_LockAudioDevice() and
 *   SDL_UnlockAudioDevice() in your code. Alternately, you may pass a NULL
 *   pointer here, and call SDL_QueueAudio() with some frequency, to queue
 *   more audio samples to be played (or for capture devices, call
 *   SDL_DequeueAudio() with some frequency, to obtain audio samples).
 * - `desired->userdata` is passed as the first parameter to your callback
 *   function. If you passed a NULL callback, this value is ignored.
 *
 * `allowed_changes` can have the following flags OR'd together:
 *
 * - `SDL_AUDIO_ALLOW_FREQUENCY_CHANGE`
 * - `SDL_AUDIO_ALLOW_FORMAT_CHANGE`
 * - `SDL_AUDIO_ALLOW_CHANNELS_CHANGE`
 * - `SDL_AUDIO_ALLOW_SAMPLES_CHANGE`
 * - `SDL_AUDIO_ALLOW_ANY_CHANGE`
 *
 * These flags specify how SDL should behave when a device cannot offer a
 * specific feature. If the application requests a feature that the hardware
 * doesn't offer, SDL will always try to get the closest equivalent.
 *
 * For example, if you ask for float32 audio format, but the sound card only
 * supports int16, SDL will set the hardware to int16. If you had set
 * SDL_AUDIO_ALLOW_FORMAT_CHANGE, SDL will change the format in the `obtained`
 * structure. If that flag was *not* set, SDL will prepare to convert your
 * callback's float32 audio to int16 before feeding it to the hardware and
 * will keep the originally requested format in the `obtained` structure.
 *
 * The resulting audio specs, varying depending on hardware and on what
 * changes were allowed, will then be written back to `obtained`.
 *
 * If your application can only handle one specific data format, pass a zero
 * for `allowed_changes` and let SDL transparently handle any differences.
 *
 * \param device a UTF-8 string reported by SDL_GetAudioDeviceName() or a
 *               driver-specific name as appropriate. NULL requests the most
 *               reasonable default device.
 * \param iscapture non-zero to specify a device should be opened for
 *                  recording, not playback
 * \param desired an SDL_AudioSpec structure representing the desired output
 *                format

 * \param allowed_changes 0, or one or more flags OR'd together

/**
 * Load the audio data of a WAVE file into memory.
 *
 * Loading a WAVE file requires `src`, `spec`, `audio_buf` and `audio_len` to
 * be valid pointers. The entire data portion of the file is then loaded into
 * memory and decoded if necessary.
 *
 * If `freesrc` is non-zero, the data source gets automatically closed and
 * freed before the function returns.
 *
 * Supported formats are RIFF WAVE files with the formats PCM (8, 16, 24, and
 * 32 bits), IEEE Float (32 bits), Microsoft ADPCM and IMA ADPCM (4 bits), and
 * A-law and mu-law (8 bits). Other formats are currently unsupported and
 * cause an error.
 *
 * If this function succeeds, the pointer returned by it is equal to `spec`
 * and the pointer to the audio data allocated by the function is written to
 * `audio_buf` and its length in bytes to `audio_len`. The SDL_AudioSpec
 * members `freq`, `channels`, and `format` are set to the values of the audio
 * data in the buffer. The `samples` member is set to a sane default and all
 * others are set to zero.
 *
 * It's necessary to use SDL_free() to free the audio data returned in
 * `audio_buf` when it is no longer used.
 *
 * Because of the underspecification of the .WAV format, there are many
 * problematic files in the wild that cause issues with strict decoders. To
 * provide compatibility with these files, this decoder is lenient in regards
 * to the truncation of the file, the fact chunk, and the size of the RIFF
 * chunk. The hints `SDL_HINT_WAVE_RIFF_CHUNK_SIZE`,
 * `SDL_HINT_WAVE_TRUNCATION`, and `SDL_HINT_WAVE_FACT_CHUNK` can be used to
 * tune the behavior of the loading process.
 *
 * Any file that is invalid (due to truncation, corruption, or wrong values in
 * the headers), too big, or unsupported causes an error. Additionally, any
 * critical I/O error from the data source will terminate the loading process
 * with an error. The function returns NULL on error and in all cases (with
 * the exception of `src` being NULL), an appropriate error message will be
 * set.
 *
 * It is required that the data source supports seeking.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```c
 * SDL_LoadWAV_RW(SDL_RWFromFile("sample.wav", "rb"), 1, &spec, &buf, &len);
 * ```
 *
 * Note that the SDL_LoadWAV macro does this same thing for you, but in a less
 * messy way:
 *
 * ```c
 * SDL_LoadWAV("sample.wav", &spec, &buf, &len);
 * ```
 *
 * \param src The data source for the WAVE data
 * \param freesrc If non-zero, SDL will _always_ free the data source
 * \param spec An SDL_AudioSpec that will be filled in with the wave file's
 *             format details
 * \param audio_buf A pointer filled with the audio data, allocated by the
 *                  function.
 * \param audio_len A pointer filled with the length of the audio data buffer
 *                  in bytes
 * \returns This function, if successfully called, returns `spec`, which will
 *          be filled with the audio data format of the wave source data.
 *          `audio_buf` will be filled with a pointer to an allocated buffer
 *          containing the audio data, and `audio_len` is filled with the
 *          length of that audio buffer in bytes.
 *
 *          This function returns NULL if the .WAV file cannot be opened, uses
 *          an unknown data format, or is corrupt; call SDL_GetError() for
 *          more information.
 *
 *          When the application is done with the data returned in
 *          `audio_buf`, it should call SDL_free() to dispose of it.

 * hear repeating bursts of audio, and SDL_CloseAudioDevice() will probably
 * deadlock.

 * at once, not only will you block the audio callback, you'll block the other
 * thread.
