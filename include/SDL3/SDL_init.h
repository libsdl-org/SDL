/**
 * Initialize the SDL library.
 *
 * SDL_Init() simply forwards to calling SDL_InitSubSystem(). Therefore, the
 * two may be used interchangeably. Though for readability of your code
 * SDL_InitSubSystem() might be preferred.
 *
 * The file I/O (for example: SDL_IOFromFile) and threading (SDL_CreateThread)
 * subsystems are initialized by default. Message boxes
 * (SDL_ShowSimpleMessageBox) also attempt to work without initializing the
 * video subsystem, in hopes of being useful in showing an error dialog when
 * SDL_Init fails. You must specifically initialize other subsystems if you
 * use them in your application.
 *
 * Logging (such as SDL_Log) works without initialization, too.
 *
 * `flags` may be any of the following OR'd together:
 *
 * - `SDL_INIT_TIMER`: timer subsystem
 * - `SDL_INIT_AUDIO`: audio subsystem; automatically initializes the events
 *   subsystem
 * - `SDL_INIT_VIDEO`: video subsystem; automatically initializes the events
 *   subsystem
 * - `SDL_INIT_JOYSTICK`: joystick subsystem; automatically initializes the
 *   events subsystem
 * - `SDL_INIT_HAPTIC`: haptic (force feedback) subsystem
 * - `SDL_INIT_GAMEPAD`: gamepad subsystem; automatically initializes the
 *   joystick subsystem
 * - `SDL_INIT_EVENTS`: events subsystem
 * - `SDL_INIT_SENSOR`: sensor subsystem; automatically initializes the events
 *   subsystem
 * - `SDL_INIT_CAMERA`: camera subsystem; automatically initializes the events
 *   subsystem
 *
 * Subsystem initialization is ref-counted, you must call SDL_QuitSubSystem()
 * for each SDL_InitSubSystem() to correctly shutdown a subsystem manually (or
 * call SDL_Quit() to force shutdown). If a subsystem is already loaded then
 * this call will increase the ref-count and return.
 *
 * \param flags subsystem initialization flags.
 * \returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure; call
 *          SDL_GetError() for more information.
