   The following set of preprocessor code forces this file to be compiled
   as C++/CX, which appears to cause Visual C++ 2012's build tools to
   create this .winmd file, and will help allow builds of SDL/WinRT apps
   to proceed without error.

   If other files in an app's project enable C++/CX compilation, then it might
   be possible for the .cpp file including SDL_main.h to be compiled without /ZW,
   for Visual C++'s build tools to create a winmd file, and for the app to
   build without APPX0702 errors.  In this case, if
   SDL_WINRT_METADATA_FILE_AVAILABLE is defined as a C/C++ macro, then
   the #error (to force C++/CX compilation) will be disabled.

   Please note that /ZW can be specified on a file-by-file basis.  To do this,
   right click on the file in Visual C++, click Properties, then change the
   setting through the dialog that comes up.
