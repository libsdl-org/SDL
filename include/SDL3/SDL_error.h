 * if (error_code) {
 *     return SDL_SetError("This operation has failed: %d", error_code);
 * }
 * ```

 * \param fmt a printf()-style message format string.

/**
 * Retrieve a message about the last error that occurred on the current
 * thread.
 *
 * It is possible for multiple errors to occur before calling SDL_GetError().
 * Only the last error is returned.
 *
 * The message is only applicable when an SDL function has signaled an error.
 * You must check the return values of SDL function calls to determine when to
 * appropriately call SDL_GetError(). You should *not* use the results of
 * SDL_GetError() to decide if an error has occurred! Sometimes SDL will set
 * an error string even when reporting success.
 *
 * SDL will *not* clear the error string for successful API calls. You *must*
 * check return values for failure cases before you can assume the error
 * string applies.
 *
 * Error strings are set per-thread, so an error set in a different thread
 * will not interfere with the current thread's operation.
 *
 * The returned string does **NOT** follow the SDL_GetStringRule! The pointer
 * is valid until the current thread's error string is changed, so the caller
 * should make a copy if the string is to be used after calling into SDL
 * again.
 *
 * \returns a message with information about the specific error that occurred,
 *          or an empty string if there hasn't been an error message set since
 *          the last call to SDL_ClearError().
