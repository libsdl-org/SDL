 * will be available as `SDL_PROP_PROCESS_STDIN_POINTER` and allows
 * SDL_WriteProcess(), standard output will be available as
 * `SDL_PROP_PROCESS_STDOUT_POINTER` and allows SDL_ReadProcess(), and
 * standard error will be available as `SDL_PROP_PROCESS_STDERR_POINTER` in
 * the properties for the created process.
 *
 * If a standard I/O stream is set to SDL_PROCESS_STDIO_REDIRECT, it is
 * connected to an existing SDL_IOStream provided by the application. Standard
 * input is provided using `SDL_PROP_PROCESS_CREATE_STDIN_POINTER`, standard

 * In order to use an SDL_IOStream with SDL_PROCESS_STDIO_REDIRECT, it must
 * have `SDL_PROP_IOSTREAM_WINDOWS_HANDLE_POINTER` or
