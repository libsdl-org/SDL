/**
 * Dynamically load the Vulkan loader library.
 *
 * This should be called after initializing the video driver, but before
 * creating any Vulkan windows. If no Vulkan loader library is loaded, the
 * default library will be loaded upon creation of the first Vulkan window.
 *
 * It is fairly common for Vulkan applications to link with libvulkan instead
 * of explicitly loading it at run time. This will work with SDL provided the
 * application links to a dynamic library and both it and SDL use the same
 * search path.
 *
 * If you specify a non-NULL `path`, an application should retrieve all of the
 * Vulkan functions it uses from the dynamic library using
 * SDL_Vulkan_GetVkGetInstanceProcAddr unless you can guarantee `path` points
 * to the same vulkan loader library the application linked to.
 *
 * On Apple devices, if `path` is NULL, SDL will attempt to find the
 * `vkGetInstanceProcAddr` address within all the Mach-O images of the current
 * process. This is because it is fairly common for Vulkan applications to
 * link with libvulkan (and historically MoltenVK was provided as a static
 * library). If it is not found, on macOS, SDL will attempt to load
 * `vulkan.framework/vulkan`, `libvulkan.1.dylib`,
 * `MoltenVK.framework/MoltenVK`, and `libMoltenVK.dylib`, in that order. On
 * iOS, SDL will attempt to load `libMoltenVK.dylib`. Applications using a
 * dynamic framework or .dylib must ensure it is included in its application
 * bundle.
 *
 * On non-Apple devices, application linking with a static libvulkan is not
 * supported. Either do not link to the Vulkan loader or link to a dynamic
 * library version.
 *
 * \param path the platform dependent Vulkan loader library name or NULL.
 * \returns true on success or false on failure; call SDL_GetError() for more
 *          information.
