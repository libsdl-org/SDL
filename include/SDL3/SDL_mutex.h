/**
 * Create a new read/write lock.
 *
 * A read/write lock is useful for situations where you have multiple threads
 * trying to access a resource that is rarely updated. All threads requesting
 * a read-only lock will be allowed to run in parallel; if a thread requests a
 * write lock, it will be provided exclusive access. This makes it safe for
 * multiple threads to use a resource at the same time if they promise not to
 * change it, and when it has to be changed, the rwlock will serve as a
 * gateway to make sure those changes can be made safely.
 *
 * In the right situation, a rwlock can be more efficient than a mutex, which
 * only lets a single thread proceed at a time, even if it won't be modifying
 * the data.
 *
 * All newly-created read/write locks begin in the _unlocked_ state.
 *
 * Calls to SDL_LockRWLockForReading() and SDL_LockRWLockForWriting will not
 * return while the rwlock is locked _for writing_ by another thread. See
 * SDL_TryLockRWLockForReading() and SDL_TryLockRWLockForWriting() to attempt
 * to lock without blocking.
 *
 * SDL read/write locks are only recursive for read-only locks! They are not
 * guaranteed to be fair, or provide access in a FIFO manner! They are not
 * guaranteed to favor writers. You may not lock a rwlock for both read-only
 * and write access at the same time from the same thread (so you can't
 * promote your read-only lock to a write lock without unlocking first).
