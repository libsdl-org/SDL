# To build and use SDL:

SDL supports a number of development environments:
- [CMake](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/INTRO-cmake)
- [Visual Studio on Windows](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/INTRO-visualstudio)
- [gcc on Windows](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/INTRO-mingw)
- [Xcode on Apple platforms](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/INTRO-xcode)
- [Android Studio](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/INTRO-androidstudio)
- [Emscripten for web](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/INTRO-emscripten)

SDL is also usable in other environments. The basic steps are to use CMake to build the library and then use the headers and library that you built in your project. You can search online to see if anyone has specific steps for your setup.

# Documentation

An API reference, tutorials, and additional documentation is available at:

https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3

# Example code

There are simple example programs in the examples directory, and you can view them online at:

https://examples.libsdl.org/SDL3

More in-depth test programs are available in the tests directory and can be built by adding `-DSDL_TESTS=ON` to the CMake command line when building SDL.
