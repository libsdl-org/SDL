# Introduction to SDL with Android Studio

We'll start by creating a simple project to build and run [hello.c](hello.c)

- Use our handy script to create a template project:
```sh
./build-scripts/create-android-project.py org.libsdl.hello docs/hello.c
```
- Run Android Studio and open the newly created build/org.libsdl.hello directory
- Build and run!

Additional information and troubleshooting is available in [README-android.md](README-android.md)
