Nokia N-Gage
============

SDL2 port for Symbian S60v1/2 with a main focus on the Nokia N-Gage
(Classic and QD) by [Michael Fitzmayer](https://github.com/mupfdev).

Compiling
---------

SDL is part of the [N-Gage SDK.](https://github.com/ngagesdk) project.
The library is included in the
[toolchain](https://github.com/ngagesdk/ngage-toolchain) as a
sub-module.

A complete example project based on SDL2 can be found in the GitHub
account of the SDK: [Example
project](https://github.com/ngagesdk/wordle).

Current level of implementation
-------------------------------

The video driver currently provides full screen video support with
keyboard input.

At the moment only the software renderer works.

Audio is not yet implemented.

Acknowledgements
----------------

Thanks to Hannu Viitala, Kimmo Kinnunen and Markus Mertama for the
valuable insight into Symbian programming.  Without the SDL 1.2 port for
CDoom, this adaptation would not have been possible.

I would like to thank my friends
[Razvan](https://twitter.com/bewarerazvan) and [Dan
Whelan](https://danwhelan.ie/), for their continuous support.  Without
you and the [N-Gage community](https://discord.gg/dbUzqJ26vs), I would
have lost my patience long ago.

Last but not least, I would like to say a special thank you to the
[EKA2L1](https://12z1.com/) team.  Thank you for all your patience and
support in troubleshooting.
