/**
 * Initialize the video subsystem, optionally specifying a video driver.

 * This function initializes the video subsystem, setting up a connection to
 * the window manager, etc, and determines the available display modes and
 * pixel formats, but does not initialize a window or graphics mode.
 *
 * If you use this function and you haven't used the SDL_INIT_VIDEO flag with
 * either SDL_Init() or SDL_InitSubSystem(), you should call SDL_VideoQuit()
 * before calling SDL_Quit().
 *
 * It is safe to call this function multiple times. SDL_VideoInit() will call
 * SDL_VideoQuit() itself if the video subsystem has already been initialized.
 *
 * You can use SDL_GetNumVideoDrivers() and SDL_GetVideoDriver() to find a
 * specific `driver_name`.
 *
 * \param driver_name the name of a video driver to initialize, or NULL for
 *                    the default driver
 * \returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure; call
 *          SDL_GetError() for more information.
